// Stack and Heap Memory in java

// Memory is divided into two parts: Stack and Heap
// Stack is used to store primitive data types and reference variables
// Heap is used to store objects

// Stack Memory
// Stack memory is used to store primitive data types and reference variables
// Stack memory is created when a program starts and destroyed when a program ends
// Stack memory is very fast
// Stack memory is very small
// Stack memory is used to store primitive data types and reference variables

// Heap Memory
// Heap memory is used to store objects
// Heap memory is created when a program starts and destroyed when a program ends
// Heap memory is very slow
// Heap memory is very large
// Heap memory is used to store objects

// inside the stack memory, there are 3 parts:
// 1. Local variables
// 2. Operand stack
// 3. Frame data

// Local variables
// Local variables are used to store primitive data types and reference variables
// Local variables are created when a method is called and destroyed when a method is ended
// Local variables are very fast
// Local variables are very small
// Local variables are used to store primitive data types and reference variables

// Operand stack
// Operand stack is used to store primitive data types and reference variables
// Operand stack is created when a method is called and destroyed when a method is ended
// Operand stack is very fast
// Operand stack is very small
// Operand stack is used to store primitive data types and reference variables

// Frame data
// Frame data is used to store primitive data types and reference variables
// Frame data is created when a method is called and destroyed when a method is ended
// Frame data is very fast
// Frame data is very small
// Frame data is used to store primitive data types and reference variables

// inside the heap memory, there are 2 parts:
// 1. Object
// 2. Class

// Object
// Object is used to store objects
// Object is created when a program starts and destroyed when a program ends
// Object is very slow
// Object is very large
// Object is used to store objects

// Class
// Class is used to store classes
// Class is created when a program starts and destroyed when a program ends
// Class is very slow
// Class is very large
// Class is used to store classes
