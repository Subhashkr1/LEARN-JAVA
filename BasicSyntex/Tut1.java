// History of Java
// Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
// Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) in the year 1995.
// Java is a successor of C++ and C.
// Java was originally called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office.
// Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee.
// Java was originally designed for interactive TV, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
// Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and is used by Oracle exclusively to designate their implementation of the Java Platform.
// Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
// Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
// Java is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
// Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
// The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
// Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
// The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
// The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
// As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License.
// Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
// Sun has also released the source code for its JVM under a GPL-compatible license.
// Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
// Java applets are written in Java programming language and can run in any browser that has a Java plug-in.
// Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
