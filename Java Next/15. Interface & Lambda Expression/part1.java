// Interface is a collection of abstract methods.
// A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
// Interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
// Interface is used to achieve abstraction.
// Interface is used to achieve multiple inheritance.
// Interface is used to achieve loose coupling.
